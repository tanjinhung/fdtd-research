  abstract = {IN his deservedly celebrated treatise on ``Sound,'' the late Sir
              John Herschel felt himself justified in saying, ``It is vain to
              conceal the melancholy truth. We are fast dropping behind. In
              Mathematics we have long since drawn the rein and given over a
              hopeless race.'' Thanks to Herschel himself, and others, the
              reproach, if perhaps then just, did not long remain so. Even in
              pure mathematics, a subject which till lately has not been much
              attended to in Britain, except by a few scattered specialists, we
              stand at this moment at the very least on a par with the {\'e}lite
              of the enormously disproportionate remainder of the world. The
              discoveries of Boole and Hamilton, of Cayley and Sylvester, extend
              into limitless regions of abstract thought, of which they are as
              yet the sole explorers. In applied mathematics no living men stand
              higher than Adams, Stokes, and W. Thomson. Any one of these names
              alone would assure our position in the face of the world as regards
              triumphs already von in the grandest struggles of the human
              intellect. But the men of the next generation---the successors of
              these long-proved knights---are beginning to win their spurs, and
              among them there is none of greater promise than Clerk-Maxwell. He
              has already, as the first holder of the new chair of Experimental
              Science in Cambridge, given the post a name which requires only the
              stamp of antiquity to raise it almost to the level of that of
              Newton. And among the numerous services he has done to science,
              even taking account of his exceedingly remarkable treatise on
              ``Heat,'' the present volumes must be regarded as pre-eminent.},
